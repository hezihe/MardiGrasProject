            <h2>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="aboutPara"><img src="images/about/paraImg1.jpg" alt="paraImg1" class="aboutImgPara">
                The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.
                Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash
                Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each
                day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades
                take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout
                New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
            </p>

            <p class="aboutPara">The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow
                the same parade
                schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well
                known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for
                naming
                celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming
                celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly African
                American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are
                strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
                inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the
                same parade schedule and route each year.</p>

            <p class="aboutPara">While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in
                New Orleans and Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a
                route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi
                Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus. While many

            <h2>Mardi Gras History</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="aboutPara">
                <img src="images/about/paraImg3.jpg" alt="paraImg3" class="aboutImgPara">
                The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River
                in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
                men
                celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the
                festivities in
                New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking
                and
                costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the
                custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on
                Mardi Gras
                took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions
                were
                lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of
                French
                descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p class="aboutPara">
                In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
                observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick
                Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what
                New Orleans had always considered
                a French
                festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
                passed from
                French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and
                its Creoles. To a
                certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of
                how their business
                prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized
                Carnival passed from
                Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century.
                The spectacle of
                Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms
                and on the
                streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely
                American."</p>
            <p class="aboutPara">
                In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
                conditions sometimes
                led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I
                and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.</p>

            <p class="aboutPara">
                In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
                surrounding
                communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the
                city. Masking,
                costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
                prevented crimes
                against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for
                these reasons, some
                in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.
            </p>

            <p class="aboutPara">
                <img src="images/about/paraImg2.jpg" alt="paraImg2" class="aboutImgPara">
                In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
                Mardi
                Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender
                or
                sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.Shortly after the law was
                passed,
                the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing
                traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protestâ€”and because the city
                claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership listsâ€”the 19th-century
                krewes
                Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended
                its
                parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.</p>

            <p class="aboutPara">
                Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
                federal
                courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights
                of
                free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.
                The
                US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.
                Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
                dues,
                and any member can have a place on a parade float.</p>

                LaToya Cantrell (born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                Louisiana, a
                post she has held since May 7, 2018. Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first black woman to hold the post.
                Before
                becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012â€“2018.</p>

            <p class="aboutPara">
                <h4>Early life and education</h4>
                Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training
                program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutPara">
                <h4>Mayor of New Orleans</h4>
                Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
                creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun
                Violence Reduction Council tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to
                rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her #fairshare
                initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As
                part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four opioid
                manufactures and distributors.
            </p>

            <p class="aboutPara">
                <h4>Awards</h4>
                In 2016, Cantrell was given a lifetime achievement award by the presidents of Tulane, Loyola and Xavier
                universities and
                the University of New Orleans for her service to the community.
