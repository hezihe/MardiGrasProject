    <hr>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;"><b>The World Famous Museum of
            Death</b> was founded in June, 1995 when JD Healy and Cathee Shultz decided to fill
        the void in death education in this country and made <i>death</i> their life’s work.</p>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;">Evolving from the controversial Rita
        Dean art gallery, the Museum of Death was originally located in San
        Diego’s 1st mortuary- the building itself once owned by Wyatt Earp. Now located in Hollywood, California and
        New Orleans, Louisiana, the Museum of Death houses the world’s largest collection of serial killer artwork,
        antique funeral ephemera, mortician and coroners instruments, Manson Family memorabilia, pet death
        taxidermy, crime scene photographs and so much more! Each location is entirely unique as the museum does not
        feature any replicas or duplicates of the exhibits or artifacts.</p>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;">The Museum of Death experience is a
        self guided tour lasting approximately 45 minutes to an hour, however
        those who can stomach it may stay as long as they like, as there are hundreds of items on display. To
        ensure that you experience the entire museum we recommend arriving no later than an hour before the
        posted closing time for that day.</p>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;">There is no age limit for the Museum
        of Death because death affects us all, however we STRONGLY
        recommend the museum only for MATURE AUDIENCES! Some content within the exhibits may be too graphic
        or explicit for children, and no children will be allowed inside without a parent being present.
        There have been a number of “falling down ovations” (people fainting) throughout the years so we
        encourage you to prepare yourself before arriving!</p>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;">There is currently 1 museum location-
        227 Dauphine Street in New Orleans,
        LA</a> (admission is $15 plus tax per person) -- and our Hollywood location is relocating,
        with details available soon.</p>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;">*Due to the high volume of visitors,
        customers with oversized items (luggage, strollers, push
        carts, etc.) may find it difficult to navigate the museum and would perhaps want to consider
        storing these items prior to arriving. We will ask to hold any type of backpack, or
        oversized bags for the consideration of all guests.</p>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;">THE FOLLOWING ITEMS AND ACTIONS ARE
        PROHIBITED BY THE MUSEUM OF DEATH:</p>

    <ul style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">
        <li>Photography of any sort</li>
        <li>Cellular phones / cellular phone use</li>

        <li>Smoking, vaping, or chewing tobacco</li>
        <li>Weapons (or anything that would interfere with another guest)</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:#F2F2F2;font-family: 'Roboto' , sans-serif; font-size: 1.5em;"><b>THE MUSEUM OF DEATH RESERVES THE
            RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE</b>
